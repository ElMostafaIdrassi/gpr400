Some years ago, i used an GPR400 PCMCIA smartcard 'adaptor',
and crawl a bit around the net to find a working driver for linux.

I've found some versions by differents authors:

- Pierrick Hascoet 
- Henry Plötz
- Jaiger

And i tried to maintain it against the linux kernel changes, and
also built debian or ubuntu packages for it. 
I also received the help of Jose Antonio Sánchez Vázquez <jasvazquez@gmail.com>.

I don't use the device anymore because my new computer doesn't have any PCMCIA
port.

So, i leave here the last sources i had *in case it helps*.
