Author  : Joe Phillips <joe.phillips@innovationsw.com> modified by Jean Schurger <jean@schurger.org>

License : See files LICENSE and COPYING.LIB

This is a IFD Handler for the GEMPLUS GPR400 hardware for use with the 
MUSCLE project PC/SC Lite package.  It requires the following:

- GEMPLUS GPR400 hardware (http://www.gemplus.com)
- gpr400_cs PCMCIA kernel module (http://www.linuxnet.com)
- pcsc-lite from the MUSCLE project (http://www.linuxnet.com)


INSTALLING

Build the IFD handler with the following command:

	$ make

Install the IFD handler by copying it to your IFD handler installation
directory (i.e. /usr/local/lib/readers/)

	# cp libgpr400_ifd.so /usr/local/lib/readers/

To use the IFD handler, make sure it is referenced in your /etc/reader.conf
file.  Also, the gpr400_cs PCMCIA kernel module must be installed in order
for this driver to function properly.  This should be done when you 
insert the physical device into your PCMCIA slot.


KNOWN ISSUES

T=0 support seems ok but T=1 support is untested and unknown to work.

Only a single GPR400 device can be handled by this IFD handler.  No LUN support.

IFDHGetCapabilities is only minimally implemented due to missing TAG_* 
definitions.

IFDHSetCapabilities is not implemented.

IFDHSetProtocolParameter is not implemented.

IFDHControl is not implemented.

Hotplug of GPR400 devices is not yet supported.


CREDITS

This IFD Handler code is based on the IFD devkit released by David Corcoran
and MUSCLE.  Visit MUSCLE on the web at http://www.linuxnet.com

This IFD handler would not be possible without the gpr400 PCMCIA kernel
driver originally developed and released by Wolf Geldmacher <wolf@comunicon.ch>
in the card-0.9.6 tarball found on the MUSCLE site.  Other source code
found in that tarball has been useful in developing this IFD handler.
